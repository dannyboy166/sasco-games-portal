# Documentation Setup Complete ✅

## What We Created (2025-11-18)

### Central Planning Folder: `/Users/danielsamus/sasco-games-portal/`

**Purpose:** Coordinate integration of 4 games into Victor's SASCO school portal

**Files:**
1. **README.md** - Complete integration plan
   - Overview of all 4 games and their roles
   - Integration roadmap (5 phases)
   - Technical specifications from Victor
   - Next steps and timeline

2. **TASKS.md** - Phase-by-phase task tracking
   - Checkboxes for all features
   - Current focus clearly marked
   - Organized by game and priority

3. **.claude/claude.md** - Claude context file
   - Full project context
   - Key people and contacts
   - Victor's integration pattern
   - Recent work history

4. **DOCUMENTATION-SETUP.md** - This file
   - What was created and why

**Git repo initialized** - Track changes to planning docs

---

### Individual Game Documentation

Each game now has `.claude/claude.md` files that:
- Explain the SASCO portal context
- Show how this game fits into the bigger picture
- Reference the central planning folder
- List integration requirements specific to that game
- Help future Claude sessions understand the full project

**Wordle** - `/Users/danielsamus/wordle-game/.claude/claude.md`
- NEW file created
- Educational game with teacher word assignment focus
- React/TypeScript architecture explained
- Build process documented

**2048** - `/Users/danielsamus/2048-game/.claude/claude.md`
- NEW file created
- Free time reward game
- Vanilla JS architecture explained  
- Simple integration needs

**Kangaroo Hop** - `/Users/danielsamus/my-kangaroo-game/CLAUDE.md`
- UPDATED existing file
- Added portal context section at top
- References central planning
- Already had extensive development docs

## Cross-References Work Perfectly

**From any game →** References central planning folder  
**From central folder →** Links to all 4 games  
**Everything connected** - No documentation silos!

---

## Next Actions

1. **Show Mum the games** and get approval
2. **Start optimizing** (check `TASKS.md` in central folder)
3. **Draft Victor email** when ready (use central README for specs)
4. **Track progress** in `TASKS.md`

**Future Claude sessions will have all the context they need!** 🚀
